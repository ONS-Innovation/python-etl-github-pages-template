## Overview

This page will contain detailed analysis of the processed data from the ETL pipeline once it has been executed.

## Current Status

⚠️ **No ETL data available yet**

The ETL pipeline has not been run yet, or no data has been processed. To generate a data report:

1. **Run the ETL pipeline locally**:
   {% if values.package_manager == 'poetry' -%}
   ```bash
   poetry run python run_etl.py --source example_data.csv --output results/processed.csv --deploy
   ```
   {% else -%}
   ```bash
   pipenv run python run_etl.py --source example_data.csv --output results/processed.csv --deploy
   ```
   {% endif %}

2. **Or wait for the GitHub Action** to run automatically when code is pushed to the main branch.

## What Will Be Available

Once the ETL pipeline runs successfully, this page will show:

- **Data Summary** - Key metrics about the processed dataset
- **Data Preview** - Sample rows from the processed data
- **Column Information** - Data types, missing values, and statistics
- **Processing Summary** - Details about the ETL transformations applied
- **Statistical Analysis** - Numerical summaries and distributions

## Getting Started

To get started with this ETL pipeline:

1. **Check the example data**: Look at `example_data.csv` to understand the input format
2. **Review the code**: Examine the modules in `{{ values.module_name }}/` to understand the processing logic
3. **Run a test**: Execute the pipeline with the example data to see it in action
